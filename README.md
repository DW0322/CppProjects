CPP PROJECTS

Welcome to CPP PROJECTS — a personal collection of small C++ projects I'm building for fun and learning. This repository is just getting started and currently includes one project in progress.

📁 Current Project

Robot Path Simulator (WIP)
A simple simulation that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path for a robot through a grid. The goal is to simulate how a robot can navigate from a start point to a target while avoiding obstacles.

🚧 Work in Progress

This project is still under development. More features, improvements, and additional projects will be added over time.

🛠 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++).

Navigate to the project folder.

Compile the code:

g++ robot_path_simulator.cpp -o robot_sim


Run the program:

./robot_sim

📌 Notes

These projects are made for learning and exploration. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as inspiration.
