Robot Path Simulator

In this project I will be making a path finding robot simulation in C++.
I have based the path to be solved through a graph, that can visually be represented as a grid or matrix. This will in turn make the up, down, left & right movements of the robot clearer.

I'm using the BSF algorithm to find the fastest path from a begining node, to the end node. I did this by ensuring that each node had a connection to a parent node for later reconstruction of the shortest path.
