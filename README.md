# CPP PROJECTS

Welcome to **CPP PROJECTS** — a personal collection of C++ projects I'm building for fun and learning. This repository has grown from simple simulations to more advanced explorations in robotics and computer graphics.

## 📁 Completed Project

### ✅ Robot Path Simulator  
A simple simulation that uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find a path for a robot through a grid. The simulation demonstrates how a robot can navigate from a start point to a target while avoiding obstacles.

### 🛠 How to Run:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ robot_path_simulator.cpp -o robot_sim
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./robot_sim
   ```

## 📁 Current Project

### 🤖 Forward Kinematics Robot Arm (2D → 3D)

I'm currently working on simulating a 2D robotic arm using forward kinematics. This involves calculating joint positions based on given angles and segment lengths. The plan is to:

Build an interactive 2D simulation.

Extend it into 3D for more complex movement.

Potentially visualize it using OpenGL for real-time rendering and interaction.


## 📌 Notes

These projects are for learning, experimentation, and skill-building. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use anything here as inspiration for your own work.
